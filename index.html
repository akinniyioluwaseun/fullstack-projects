  <h1>Summary</h1>  

  <p>I am an organized and dependable exploration geologist with expertise in mapping and sampling, data compilation, 
    core drilling, core logging, and 3D modeling within the exploration industry. I efficiently examine both organic 
    and inorganic rocks, analyze various salts, and conduct drilling procedures to study rocks, 
    as well as evaluate the occur-rence of hydrocarbons, coal, limestone, lithium, lead, zinc, iron,
    and other metallic minerals. I successfully achieve demanding development objectives according to schedules
    while producing impeccable results. I am commended for meticulously implementing efficient techniques,
    which have saved on wastage and costs by 30%. </p>
